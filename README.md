# Analysis of betting strategies

Final project for the class Mathematical Modeling.
In the beginning we have 1$. Cards are being drawn from a standard, well shuffled deck. Provided are three strategies for betting on the color of the next card.

- Strategy A: We always bet all of our money on the color that is MORE likely to occur. If bother colors are equally likely to occur, we toss a coin. 
- Strategy B: We wait until there is only one color left, and bet all of our money on the remaining color.
- Strategy C: While there are still two colors left in the deck, we bet all of our money on the LESS likely color, then bet all our money on the remaining color.

I wrote scripts that simulate these strategies over a large number of games. The results are written in my report 'leshtov_mm_project.pdf'.
